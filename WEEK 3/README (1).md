# 🗑️ Garbage Classification Using Deep Learning

This project is a part of the AICTE Edunet Foundation internship, focusing on classifying garbage images into predefined categories using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The objective is to support automated waste sorting systems by building a robust image classifier.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is the **TrashType Image Dataset**, which contains labeled images of different types of garbage. Common categories include:

- Cardboard  
- Glass  
- Metal  
- Paper  
- Plastic  
- Trash (miscellaneous)

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Load and preprocess the image dataset.
- Apply image augmentation techniques.
- Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- Evaluate the model on a test set.
- Save the trained model for future inference.
